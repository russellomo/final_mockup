Based off of the idea found [here](https://russellomo.github.io/essays/final-project-idea.html)

Buttons and the Navbar do not work in this mockup so you can use the following to access the pages
/home
/login
/registration
/view-listing
/create-listing
/view-profile


<img class="ui large left floated rounded image" src="/readme_images/landing.png">
<img class="ui large left floated rounded image" src="/readme_images/login.png">
<img class="ui large left floated rounded image" src="/readme_images/registration.png">

Above are the landing page, the login page and the registration page. From the landing page, a user can 
access the login and registration page via the respective buttons.

When a user logs in they are in a home page which shows the listings they have posted, as well as the listings
that they are "interested" in, essentially listings that the user will potentially go through. Clicking on the
cards will take you to a more descriptive screen where you can also link to the seller's profile. The search page, where the user will actually find listings, will be essentailly this page with a search bar option.

Users are able to rate other users based on their expereince with them, which is then averaged.

The page to create a listing contains a few text fields for the title of the book and some drop downs for 
ease of use for the user and the programmer.
